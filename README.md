## Problem 1 - Recent Posts 
**<ins>Objectives:</ins>**
- Show off the most 10 recent posts that has a fast enough update times in order to be displayed on a screen at a building lobby.

**<ins>Changes made:</ins>**

Since the provided query is dependent on timestamp for retrieving the 10 most
recent posts, index should be created on the timestamp in descending order. 
With this, the data base can utilize a B-tree data structure to quickly fetch information
 that is stored in descending order:

`CREATE INDEX post_timestamp_idx ON posts(post_timestamp DESC);`

Instead of doing a table scan through a million of rows to sort, the query can 
now instead just fetch the 10 most recent posts immediately. 

After the creation of index based on post timestamp, run time of the query 
has reduced from 4841 ms to 8 ms!

|        | PUBLIC | scanCount | Query time      |
|--------|---|---|-----------------|
| Before | PUBLIC.POSTS.tableScan | 995087 | 10 rows, 4841 ms |
 | After | PUBLIC.POST_TIMESTAMP_IDX | 10 | 10 rows, 8 ms    |

## Problem 2 - Somewhat Strange Query
**<ins>Objectives:</ins>**
- Reduce query time from 300-600 ms to below 100 ms

**<ins>Changes made:</ins>**
- Creating composite index: `CREATE INDEX posts_composite_idx ON posts (post_timestamp ASC, content, author);`

With the creation of composite index, the query run time was reduced to below 100 ms. Infact, it was at around 10 - 20 ms!

Composite index optimizes the query that filters based on content, post_timestamp and author. The composite index was created with columns with higher selectivity ahead of those with lower selectivity. 

|        | PUBLIC | scanCount | Query time      |
|--------|---|---|-----------------|
| Before | PUBLIC.POSTS.tableScan | 995087 | 46 rows, 590 ms |
| After | PUBLIC.POSTS_COMPOSITE_IDX | 16874 | 46 rows, 13 ms    |

Intially, I experimented with the following:

**Attempt 1:** Creating indexes separately for timestamp in ascending order, content, and author

Result from attempt 1 did not reduce query time to below 100 ms. In fact, it was in ~200 ms

**Attempt 2:**

- Creating indexes separately for timestamp in ascending order, content, and author
- Replacing commands UPPER() and SUBSTR() to content LIKE '%C' and to author LIKE '__son%' respectively

Result from attempt 2 also did not reduce query time to below 100 ms. In fact, it was also at around ~200 ms
