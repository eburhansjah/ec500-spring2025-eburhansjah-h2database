## Problem 1 - Recent Posts 
**Objectives:**
- Show off the most 10 recent posts that has a fast enough update times in order to be displayed on a screen at a building lobby.

**<u>Changes made:</u>**

Since the provided query is dependent on timestamp for retrieving the 10 most
recent posts, index should be created on the timestamp in descending order. 
With this, the data base can utilize a B-tree data structure to quickly fetch information
 that is stored in descending order:

`CREATE INDEX post_timestamp_idx ON posts(post_timestamp DESC);`

Instead of doing a table scan through a million of rows to sort, the query can 
now instead just fetch the 10 most recent posts immediately. 

After the creation of index based on post timestamp, run time of the query 
has reduced from 4841 ms to 8 ms!

|        | PUBLIC | scanCount | Query time      |
|--------|---|---|-----------------|
| Before | PUBLIC.POSTS.tableScan | 995087 | 10 row, 4841 ms |
 | After | PUBLIC.POST_TIMESTAMP_IDX | 10 | 10 row, 8 ms    |

## Problem 3 - Really Fast Single Row Responses
### Problem 3.1 
 
<What index does H2DB end up using?  Explain the pros and cons of each index that you created.>
 
### Problem 3.2 
ï»¿
<Which of the indexes that you created for 3.1 would you expect to be used now.  Please explain.>
 
### Problem 3.3
 
<Can you modify one of the indexes from 3.2 to make this query even faster?  Explain why your change to the index made the query even faster.>
 
## Problem 4 - Table Join Order
### Problem 4.1 
 
<Your modified query here>
 
### Problem 4.2
 
<List each of the four possible join orders and explain why or why not that particular join order will perform well or poorly.>
